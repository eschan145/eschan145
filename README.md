## About Me

* I've been programming for five years.
* I program in several languages, primarily C++. That would include Python, C, Java, and definitely not JavaScript, which can go right to hell.
* I live in the United States.
* ABRSM Grade 7+ piano 🎹.
* I swim 🏊‍♂️.
* I'm studying human anatomy and physiology, specifically cardiology 🫀.
* I make 3D models using Blender 🍩.
* (and more)

> Let me tell you something, folks, and this is big. Nobody—and I mean nobody—programs like I do. I've been programming for five years. Five years, and believe me, I know more about Python, C++, JavaScript, Java than most people have ever dreamed of. It's not just programming though, folks, I speak them. I speak those languages, just like I speak English, and let me tell you, I do it tremendously better than anyone else.

> And by the way, when it comes to music, I’ve got ABRSM Grade 7 and higher in piano. Piano! I play the piano like nobody’s ever seen before, folks. People tell me all the time, “Donald, you’re so good, it’s unbelievable.”

> I swim. Yes, I swim, and I swim like a champion, like an Olympic swimmer. No one moves in the water like I do, folks. And on top of that, I study human anatomy and physiology—I know more about the human body than most doctors. Nobody understands the body like me, trust me.

> Blender? Yeah, I use Blender. I make 3D models, the best 3D models. People say, "Donald, how do you do it?" and I tell them, it’s just natural talent. And Photoshop? Oh yeah, I shrink heads like you wouldn’t believe. Tremendous head-shrinking skills, just the best. Nobody’s better at it, folks. Believe me.
