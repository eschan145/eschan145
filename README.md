Semi-professional programmer. Fluent in Python and a bit of C++ and C#. Currently I'm taking Algebra II, in 7th Grade (I'm in a private school).

I first started coding in 4th Grade, learning Python from the book _Python for Kids_ by Jason R. Briggs. I advanced quickly, creating a 300-line calculator and moved to creating GUIs with `tkinter` and finding game libraries like Pygame. After using Pygame for a few months, I found out that it didn't have much functionality and good documentation. It was also slow. So, on my reserach, I discovered Pyglet and Arcade.

I am usually pretty busy with school, but here are some projects that I contribute and work with::

1. [`pyglet`](https://pyglet.org/)

   pyglet is a powerful, yet easy to use Python library for developing games and other visually-rich applications on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. It supports windowing, user interface event handling, Joysticks, OpenGL graphics, loading images and videos, and playing sounds and music. All of this with a friendly Pythonic API, that's simple to learn and doesn't get in your way.
   
   pyglet is provided under the BSD open-source license, allowing you to use it for both commercial and other open-source projects with very little restriction.

2. [`arcade`](https://api.arcade.academy/en/latest/)
   
   Arcade is an easy-to-learn Python library for creating 2D video games. It is ideal for people learning to program, or developers that want to code a 2D game without learning a complex framework.
      
I am interested in GUI and game development. Feel free to ask me for help on a project; e.g. GUI for a game, graphics, etc. I usually don't charge anything.
